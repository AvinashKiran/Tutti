Tutti is a Swift library that can be used to create iOS tutorials and onboarding
experieces. It's currently limited to the functionality I need in my own apps. I
will extend it as those apps become more sophisticated over time.



## Getting started

I have currently not had time to setup a demo that shows how you build a custom
tutorial on top of this library. For now, have a look at the code.

Feel free to create a demo project for this project, that demonstrates how this
library can be used to create great tutorials and onboarding experiences.



## Example

To run the demo project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example
directory first. Note that the demo project is empty and only verifies that the
pod compiles properly.



## Requirements

Tutti requires iOS 8 or later.



## CocoaPods

Tutti will be added to CocoaPods as soon as it is used by emoji apps that
are live on the app store.
