 This presenter displays hints using a speech bubble that is
 pointing at the target view.
 
 The `BubbleView` class is a fork of the great `EasyTipView`
 GitHub repo. I had to fork it, since I could not find a way
 for the demo app to have more dependencies than the library.
 
 The `BubbleView` class comes with all the bells and whisles
 from `CalloutView`, for instance its great appearance setup.
 For more info on how style `BubbleView`, just check out the
 readme at https://github.com/teodorpatras/CalloutView.
