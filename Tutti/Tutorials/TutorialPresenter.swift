 Tutorial presenters are used to present tutorials to a user.
 By separating tutorials from their presentations, tutorials
 can be presented in many different ways.
 
 Tutti comes with a view controller presenter, which you can
 use to quickly get started. However, you will probably want
 to create custom presenters in your various apps.
