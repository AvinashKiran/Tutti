 This hint presenter can display hints with the `EasyTipView`
 Swift library (`https://github.com/teodorpatras/EasyTipView`).
 
 To use this hint presenter, you must first add `EasyTipView`
 to your app, with e.g. Carthage or CocoaPods. You must then
 uncomment the disabled lines below and remove the alert one.
 
 This presenter is not added to `Tutti`, since it requires a
 dependency to `EasyTipView`. Instead, if you want to use it,
 just copy this class to any app that uses `EasyTipView`.
 
 To enable this presenter in the `Tutti` demo app, just open
 the `Cartfile` and uncomment the commented out `EasyTipView`
 line, run `carthage update --platform ios` then finally add
 `EasyTipView` to the app. You should then be able to enable
 the disabled lines below and run the app.
