 This hint presenter can display hints with the `CalloutView`
 Swift library (`https://github.com/teodorpatras/CalloutView`).
 
 To use this hint presenter, you must first add `CalloutView`
 to your app, with e.g. Carthage or CocoaPods. You must then
 uncomment the disabled lines below and remove the alert one.
 
 This presenter is not added to `Tutti`, since it requires a
 dependency to `CalloutView`. Instead, if you want to use it,
 just copy this class to any app that uses `CalloutView`.
 
 To enable this presenter in the `Tutti` demo app, just open
 the `Cartfile` and uncomment the commented out `CalloutView`
 line, run `carthage update --platform ios` then finally add
 `CalloutView` to the app. You should then be able to enable
 the disabled lines below and run the app.
